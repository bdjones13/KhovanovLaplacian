up to 9 crossings, only K[8,12] suspicious (said distinct, shouldn't be).

list of amphichiral knots with 10 crossings: 33, 37, 43, 45, 79, 81, 88, 99, 109, 115, 118, 123, 109


apparent errors:
	distinct eigs but amphichiral: 43, 37, 8_12
	symmetric eigs but non-amphiciral:
apparent correct:
	distinct eigs and non-amphichiral: 48, 71, 104, 91,
	symmetric eigs and amphichiral: 17, 45, 33, 79, 81, 99, 88, 115, 123, 118, 109


What do 48, 71, 91, and 104 have in common that 43 and 37 do not? what about 8_12?
is it strongly invertible-ness?

strongly invertible: 48, 

bridge index 2 are always strongly invertible: 8_12, 10_43, 10_37, 10_17, 10_45, 10_33, 

the criteria is not strongly-invertible, it has to be something else.
